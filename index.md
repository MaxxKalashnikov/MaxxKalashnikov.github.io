## Features

Here are some basic features supported by GitHub Pages:

- **Easy to Use**: Markdown is simple and quick to write.
- **Task Lists**: Supported with the following syntax:
  - [x] Task 1 (Completed)
  - [ ] Task 2 (Not completed)
- **Blockquotes**: Supported for adding notes, tips, or warnings:
  > **NOTE**: This is an important note.
  
  > **TIP**: Hereâ€™s a helpful tip!

- **Tables**: Easily create tables with Markdown:
